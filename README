This is a demo application for Apache Wicket and Groovy integration, with
support for hot reloading of groovy source codes.
To get it running on Jetty - mvn jetty:run

View the output with - curl http://localhost:7070/wicket-groovy/wicket/

Try plaing with the groovy source files in target/classes folder :).
