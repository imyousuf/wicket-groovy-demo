This is a demo application for Apache Wicket and Groovy integration, with
support for hot reloading of groovy source codes.

To get it running on Jetty - mvn jetty:run
View the output with - curl http://localhost:7070/wicket-groovy/wicket/

To get it running on Tomcat - mvn tomcat:run
View the output with - curl http://localhost:8080/wicket-groovy/wicket/

To get it running on GlassFish - mvn glassfish:run
View the output with - curl http://localhost:9090/wicket-groovy/wicket/

Try playing with the groovy source files in target/classes folder :) or simply
update them from IDE and execute "mvn resources:resources" while the container
is running and refresh your page.
